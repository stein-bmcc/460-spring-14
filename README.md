MMP 460 Spring 2014
=============

This repository will house the class files for spring 2014. All class files will be placed here. That is still a work in progress. If you click the download zip link on the bottom right of the page you will get all of the files. If you have a GitHub account, you can also fork this to get your own copy.

In order to make it easier to download files for a particular class session or resource I have created releases with just the files for a particular class. Click on [releases](https://github.com/stein-bmcc/460-spring-14/releases) to view them and download the files.
