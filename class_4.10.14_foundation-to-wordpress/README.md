## About this Folder
This folder was created as a base to show you how to convert a prototype created in Foundation to a page Template in Reverie.

#### prototype folder
This folder holds the files needed to make static prototypes in Foundation. This is a place where you can come and plan out how a page might work. The file we will focus on in class is single.html. We will convert it to theme files single.php and content-single.php.

#### example-theme-files
This folder is empty to start.

After we work on this in class I will post up another version of the folder with the files we create. That version will just contain the single.php and content-single.php files and not the rest of the theme files you would need for a full theme.

If you miss class or want to try them out, you would copy from this folder into your child theme folder.
